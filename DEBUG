Debugging
---------
Debugging may be enabled by setting log_level to 'debug' in the omega.yml
config file. Log filtering will be disabled in omega-server and additional
debugging rjr methods will be loaded which may be invoked by the end user
to retrieve server runtime statistics.

See the lib/rjr/inspect and lib/*/rjr/inspect modules for the API and
implementation of these debugging methods.

The omega-status utility can be used to quickly query a set of the high
level debugging methods for information and the omega-console command
provides an interactive utility which to invoke omega rjr methods.
